# Streaming Music Platform

This repository contains the code for a streaming music platform. The codebase is organized into multiple top-level directories to separate different parts of the system.

## Directory Structure

- `backend/` – server side code and services
  - `streaming-service/` – Spring Boot service
- `frontend/` – user facing application (placeholder)
- `docs/` – project documentation

Each service or application can maintain its own README explaining build and run instructions.
